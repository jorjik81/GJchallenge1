## Goal/s
Refactor starter code with no changes in website's appearance or functionality.

## Requirements
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## Description (what was done)
I reviewed the starter code and without changing website's appearance or functionality made the following improvements in the code:
In HTML file,
I added Title "Horiseon Social Solution Servicer, Inc. website"
I placed navigation links within <nav>element
I replaced div tag with header (added header to the code)
I replaced <div class="hero"></div>  with  <section class="hero" name="background image"></section> and added the name .
I replaced <div class="content"> with <main class="content">
I replaced <div class="search-engine-optimization"> with  <article id="search-engine-optimization" class="img"> ( changed div tag to article, by adding Id selector made navigation link functioning, I gave all 3 images in the article ellement class="img" and styled them together)
I added alt attribute to all images in <article> element
in CSS file I styled <article> section as .img / .img img and .img h1 h1 h3 instead if what it was before (many separate selectors)
in the next section I replaced div elements with section
I added alt attributes to the images
for the section on the right, I replaced <div> with <aside> element
I added <footer> element instead of <div>
